# ADR 4: Mobile Platform – React Native

**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Status:** Accepted  

**Context:**  
The CMS must allow customers to submit complaints via mobile devices with similar UX to the web version.

**Decision:**  
Use **React Native** to share logic with React web while maintaining cross-platform (iOS/Android) support.

**Consequences:**  
Shared codebase reduces development effort  
 Supports offline-first capabilities  
⚠️ Slightly slower than fully native apps  

**Alternatives:**  
- Flutter → good UI but less alignment with React web stack.

**References:**  
- React Native (2024). *Documentation and API Reference.*
