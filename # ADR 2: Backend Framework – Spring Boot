** Title** Back-end Infrastructure
**Date:** 2025-11-09  
**Status:** Accepted  

**Context:**  
The backend must support REST APIs, high scalability, and security integration with (OAuth2/JWT) authentication and authorization system. 

**Decision:**  
 **Spring Boot** for backend microservices. It provides built-in dependency injection, REST controllers, Spring Security, and JPA/Hibernate integration.

**Consequences:**  
 Mature ecosystem and enterprise support  
 Rapid API development and strong integration with databases 
 Suitable for a Hybrid Microservices Architecture layered with a clean architecture 
⚠️ Slightly higher learning curve for configuration  

**Alternatives:**  
- Node.js → non-blocking I/O but lacks strong typing.  
- Quarkus → new, less community support.

** Why not NodeJS?
- while suitable for lightweight APIs and real-time features, it lacks built-in enterprise features, requiring multiple third-party packages for equivalent functionality.
