**Status:** Accepted  

**Context:**  
CMS System have to maintain clear front-end design for NFR of usability.

**Decision:**  
The use of Boostrap + Thyleaf

**Consequences:**  
This approach resulted in a highly testable and maintainable front-end view a with a clear separation of concerns between presentation and business logic.
However, it introduced a minor abstraction overhead due to additional templating layers.

**Alternatives:**

-Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
